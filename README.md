The LLVM infrastructure is a popular compiler ecosystem widely used in the tech industry and academia. This technology is crucial for both experienced and aspiring compiler developers looking to make an impact in the field. Written by Quentin Colombet, a veteran LLVM contributor and architect of the GlobalISel framework, this book provides a primer on the main aspects of LLVM, with an emphasis on its backend infrastructure; that is, everything needed to transform the intermediate representation (IR) produced by frontends like Clang into assembly code and object files.
You’ll learn how to write an optimizing code generator for a toy backend in LLVM. The chapters will guide you step by step through building this backend while exploring key concepts, such as the ABI, cost model, and register allocation. You’ll also find out how to express these concepts using LLVM's existing infrastructure and how established backends address these challenges. Furthermore, the book features code snippets that demonstrate the actual APIs.
By the end of this book, you’ll have gained a deeper understanding of LLVM. The concepts presented are expected to remain stable across different LLVM versions, making this book a reliable quick reference guide for understanding LLVM.</details>

  <summary><h2>Requirements for this book</summary>
To follow the instructions in this book, you need LLVM 20 installed on your system, running on Windows, macOS, or Linux operating systems.

Navigate in the different `chX` directory and look at the examples provided and do the exercises when applicable.
Each directory has its own README.md with specific directions.

Note:
The exercises have been tested with the open source repository of LLVM at the Git hash 424c2d9b7e4d from February 13th 2025. Which is LLVM 20.1.1.

Some of the exercises interact directly with the LLVM C++ API. This API has no stability guarantee therefore it is possible that newer or older version of LLVM will not work with these exercises.

For exercises that use the LLVM C++ API, build LLVM in `~/dev/llvm-project/build`. Install Ninja, Clang (`clang` and `clang++`), and LLD (`ld.lld`), and make sure they are available on your `PATH`.

Run the following command from the exercise directory containing `CMakeLists.txt`:

```bash
cmake -GNinja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
  -DLLVM_DIR="$HOME/dev/llvm-project/build/lib/cmake/llvm" \
  -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG="-g -stdlib=libc++" \
  -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="-fuse-ld=lld" \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_RPATH="$HOME/usr/llvm-23.1.2/lib/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu" \
  -Bbuild .
ninja -Cbuild
```

`LLVM_DIR` points to the directory containing `LLVMConfig.cmake` inside your LLVM build tree. These options select a Debug build with Clang and LLD and export `build/compile_commands.json` for editor and tooling support. Each exercise README includes the same configuration, with additional options where needed.

Follow the READMEs in the different directories when you get there.

## Errata

* Page 6: Under the heading _Identifying the right version of the tools_, in step 1 the hyperlink on the URL [https://releases.llvm.org/] in the digital formats redirects to [https://www.python.org/downloads/]. Please copy and paste the link [https://releases.llvm.org/] in the browser to navigate to the correct webpage.
  Also, the sentence phrase "With no further **due**" should be "With no further **ado**".
* Page 11: In the command `$ git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm/project.git`, the URL should be `https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git`. Therefore, the first line becomes `$ git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git`.
* Page 31: In the command `$ cmake –GNinja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=${BUILD_DIR}/bin/clang ${TESTSUITE_DIR}`, `–` should be replaced with `-`. In the command `$ cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=${BUILD_DIR}/bin/clang -C${TESTSUITE_DIR}/cmake/cache/<specificOption>.cmake ${TESTSUITE_DIR}`, `cache` should be replaced with `caches`. Same to `/cmake/cache/O3.cmake`.
* Page 71: In the description below _Figure 3.4_, the sentence "Because of that, inserting a store in A and **reloading in B** means that the whole dotted region needs to play nicely with this memory location." should be "Because of that, inserting a store in A and **reloading in C** means that the whole dotted region needs to play nicely with this memory location."
* Page 71: The sentence "At the IR level, you can check if an edge is critical using the `isCriticalEdge` function from the `IR` library." should be "At the IR level, you can check if an edge is critical using the `isCriticalEdge` function from the `Analysis` library.". (Library name is changed from `IR` to `Analysis`.)
* Page 75: In the sentence "For this exercise, the linkage type does not matter; you can pick whatever enum value you want – for example, `GlobalValue::CommonLinkage`", `CommonLinkage` is actually the one linkage type that doesn't work for functions. Instead, one can use the `GlobalValue::ExternalLinkage` enum value in this case.
* Page 80: In the C program in first question under _Quiz_, `res` should be declared as `int res = 0;` after the first line (`int foo(int b) {`) and before the `for` loop. Also, in the following diagram, there should be an additional arrow from the top rectangle going to the bottom most rectangle, so that it reflects the case where the loop is not entered and the function directly returns `res`.
* Page 86: In the last paragraph first sentence "Using the same code snippet as the previous section, a frontend generates an IR that resembles what is depicted in _Figure 4.2_", the correct image reference is _Figure 4.1_.
* Page 92: In Figure 4.5, the labels on the left side should just be `getOperand(0)` and `getOperand(1)`. In both the lines, `getopenand(0) =>` and `getopenand(n) =>` are to be disregarded.
* Page 92: In the second bullet point, in the sentence "To put it simply, idom(`n`) is the last/closet node that dominates `n`.", "**closet**" should be "**closest**".
* Page 106: In _Figure 4.6_, the block at the center labelled as "excluding" should be "exiting".
* Page 130: In the sentence "You mark an analysis as preserved by calling `AnalysisUsage::setPreserved</*AnalysisPass*/>()`, `AnalysisUsage::setPreserved` should be `AnalysisUsage::addPreserved`.
* Page 183: There is a typo in the name of the static function to check whether a function is an intrinsic. The proper function is `Function::isTargetIntrinsic` not `Function::isTargetInstrinsic`.
* Page 209: In the "Value tracking" section there a typo in the number of bits that will be set to zeros for `%a`. The correct value here is two: "the first two least significant bits of `%a` will be zeros".
* Page 277: "and it is possible to call the TargetMachine::addPassesToEmitPasses method" should be "TargetMachine::addPassesToEmitFile".
* Page 361: The term `MCInstrPrinter` should be `MCInstPrinter`.
* Page 363: Both the instances of the term `XXXInstrPrinter` should be `XXXInstPrinter`.
* Page 455: In _Table 17.1_, under the **Original code** column on the left side, the line `%vec1 = insertelement <2 x i32> %vec, i32 %a, i32 1` should be `%vec1 = insertelement <2 x i32> %vec, i32 %b, i32 1` (i.e. **%a** should be **%b**).
* Page 504: The sentence "The bindings are simple instantiations of the `ReadAdvance` and `WriteRes` classes or instantiations of `InstR`." should be "The bindings are simple instantiations of the `ReadAdvance` and `WriteRes` classes or instantiations of `InstRW`.". (`InstR` is changed to `InstRW`.)
* Page 529: `such a convention in Figure 20.3.`, Page 534: `take a look at Figure 20.3`, Page 536: `illustrate it in Figure 20.3.`, Page 539: `Figure 20.3 shows one of the ways`, `Figure 20.3 shows a simplified view of the stack`, all of Figure 20.3 should be Figure 20.2
* Page 531: CreateFixedSpillStackObject method of the MachineRegisterInfo class, `MachineRegisterInfo` should be `MachineFrameInfo`.
